Fake News Detection

This project is a machine learning-based solution to detect whether a given news article is real or fake. Using a Passive Aggressive Classifier and TF-IDF vectorization, the system is trained on a labeled dataset to achieve high accuracy and reliable performance.

Features

- Loads and merges real and fake news datasets  
- Cleans and prepares the text for ML processing  
- Uses TF-IDF to convert text into numeric vectors  
- Trains a Passive Aggressive Classifier  
- Evaluates model with classification report and accuracy metrics

Model Performance

| Metric     | Score     |
|------------|-----------|
| Accuracy   | 99.45%    |
| Precision  | 99%+      |
| Recall     | 99%+      |
| F1-Score   | 99%+      |

Sample Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support  
           0       0.99      1.00      0.99      4733  
           1       0.99      0.99      0.99      4247  

Conclusion:  
The model is highly accurate in distinguishing fake news from real news. It performs well on both classes with minimal overfitting, thanks to the efficiency of Passive Aggressive learning and robust feature extraction.
